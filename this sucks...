I am a lost boi from neverland.
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan.
And when we're bored we play in the woods.
Usually hanging out with Captain Hook.
Run, Run, Lost Boi. They say to me. 
Away from all reality.

Neverland is home, to lost bois like me.
And lost bois like me are free.
Nevrland is home, to lost bois like me.
And lost bois like me are free.
